# Project Overview

## What is Campanha de Louvor?

Campanha de Louvor (Praise Campaign) is a spiritual initiative that focuses on systematically praising God's attributes. The campaign follows a structured approach that spans over 7 weeks, with each week dedicated to a specific theme of God's character.

## How it Works

- The campaign runs for exactly 7 weeks, always starting on a Sunday
- Each week has a specific theme (e.g., "O Amor de Deus", "A Santidade de Deus")
- Each day of the week highlights a specific attribute of God related to that week's theme
- When the 7-week cycle completes, it automatically restarts, making it an endless campaign
- The official start date for calculations is January 5th, 2025

## Campaign Structure

1. **Week 1**: O Amor de Deus (The Love of God)
2. **Week 2**: A Santidade de Deus (The Holiness of God)
3. **Week 3**: A Majestade de Deus (The Majesty of God)
4. **Week 4**: A Justiça de Deus (The Justice of God)
5. **Week 5**: A Fidelidade de Deus (The Faithfulness of God)
6. **Week 6**: A Misericórdia de Deus (The Mercy of God)
7. **Week 7**: A Integridade de Deus (The Integrity of God)
